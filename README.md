## Overview

This project is a **Star Wars character and movie guide website** built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Star Wars API (SWAPI). It allows users to view a list of Star Wars characters and load information about a related movie when a character is selected. It is also my homework project.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with **APIs and JavaScript**, while also creating a clean and functional user interface.  

## Features  
- **Responsive design** – works on desktop and mobile using a grid system.  
- **Character list loaded from API** – displays Star Wars characters dynamically.  
- **Movie information display** – shows movie title, director, release date, poster, and opening crawl.  
- **Interactive interface** – clicking a character loads related movie information.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, SASS  
- **API:** Star Wars API (https://swapi.info)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Structure  
The website consists of the following main parts:  

- **Header:** Website title and navigation menu.  
- **Characters Section:** Displays a list of Star Wars characters loaded from the API.  
- **Movie Section:** Displays movie information related to the selected character.  
- **Footer:** Basic project information.  

The layout uses a responsive grid system for proper structure and spacing.
